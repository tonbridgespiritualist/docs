# Expense management

FreeAgent provides a wide number of tools to manage expenses and track your balance owed. These tools allow us to monitor cash coming in and out of the centre and making sure we can reconcile reciepts properly to comply with bookkeeping standards.

## Creating an expense

Creating an expense in FreeAgent is quick and simple.

2. From the top menu bar select "Expenses"
3. Select the "Add New" button and then select "Expense"
4. In the attachment section upload a clear photo of the receipt.
{% include alert.html type="info" title="Auto populated data" content="FreeAgent attempts to save you time by auto populating data it can interpret from the receipt. If there is other purchases on the receipt that aren't included in the expense then be sure to modify the value." %}
5. Choose the closest possible category for your expense.
{% include alert.html type="info" title="Example" content="You would select Stationery for buying a duplicate book." %}
6. Update the date of the expense to the day of purchase (these should be entered same day if possible to ensure speedy repayment).
7. Ensure the monetary details and description are submitted then submit.

## Checking your owed balance

You can check your owed balance from the homepage.
1. [Login to FreeAgent](https://tonbridgespiritualist.freeagent.com) (tonbridgespiritualist.freeagent.com)
2. Find the expense tile on the homepage.
3. Your recent expenses will be listed and you will also be able to see at the top of the tile the current owed balance.
{% include alert.html type="info" title="Owed balance" content="Transactions pull through from the bank once a day, this means the balance may not clear down to £0 until the day after you recieve the money. On the other hand, the balance may have cleared down to £0 before you have the cash in hand as petty cash is recorded as it is taken and not as it is given." %}
