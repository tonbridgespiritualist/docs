# Registering a tonbridgespiritualist.com domain

The Tonbridge Spiritualist Centre domain structure is divided into 3 sections:
- department
- service
- general

Each subdomain type has a different use scenario and registration falls under different criterias.

## Organisational subdomains
The Secretary's Office maintains a list of organisations within tonbridgespiritualist.com and therefore manages organisational registration on behalf of organisations. The tech lead will need to get in contact with TSC Digital and request their subdomain be propagated to their respective namespace.    

In terms of the naming on the subdomain, these are maintained by the Secretary's Office and therefore cannot be changed. If organisations want alternate subdomains, they will need to register a general subdomain with the appropriate address they would like.


| Department | Secretary's Office            |
| Shortcode  | sec                           |
| Subdomain  | sec.tonbridgespiritualist.com |

### Registering a subdomain as a sub-organisation
A sub-organisation within an organisation (for example, TSC Digital), the domain will be registered as a subdomain of the organisational domain, and using the **full organisational name** (for example, TSC Digital receive the domain digital.sec.tonbridgespiritualist.com), if the suborganisation would like a top-level subdomain, they will need to register a general subdomain.

## Service subdomain
Service domains are registered with TSC Digital directly. An organisation needs to provide the shortname which the service will be registered with on both tonbridgespiritualist.com and the subdomain, and the page and subdomain will be registered. Generic subdomains will be refered to the Secretary for final decisions (for example, Getting started with online virtual sessions is using the generic `get-started` shortname, the Secretary approved of this registration as the service was essential to the operation of the centre, although this subdomain was issued on the basis that it will be later returned voluntarily and will take on a new shortname.

| Service    | Get started with virtual centre sessions      |
| Shortname  | get-started                                   |
| Subdomain  | get-started.service.tonbridgespiritualist.com |
| URL        | tonbridgespiritualist.com/get-started         |
| Conditions | Returned when no longer needed                |

## General subdomain
In some cases it may be necessary to register additional subdomains for specific purposes, whilst every attempt must be made to prevent registering additional subdomains, there may be a few reasons why:
- registering a subdomain because multiple organisations are involved
- registering a subdomain because it doesn't make sense to have it hosted within a department's space (e.g., open-day.sec.tonbridgespiritualist.com appears to be an internal service relating to an Open event.)
- registering a subdomain because the intended use of the subdomain is as a public campaign, but not as a service where the user completely interacts with the organisation (e.g. registering whats-happening.tonbridgespiritualist.com in order to inform the public about what is happening in centre, but in a way which would not be appropriate on the main website.)   

In these cases, it would be the best idea to register a subdomain. Your domain will be delegated to the same nameservers as your primary department subdomain is, it is the responsibility of the Digital Manager in the Department to inform us if that is not correct.    

General subdomains will be considered on a case-by-case basis. For example, roadmap.tonbridgespiritualist.com could be considered a web app of multiple different uses, including a roadmap to reopening (Coronavirus), a roadmap for digital services and a roadmap for centre development in general. Therefore, it will most likely not be registered to any organisation.
